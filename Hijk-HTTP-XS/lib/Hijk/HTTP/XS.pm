=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use strict;
    use warnings;
    use Socket qw(PF_INET SOCK_STREAM sockaddr_in inet_aton $CRLF);
    use Data::Dumper;
    use Hijk::HTTP::XS qw(fetch);

    my $soc;
    socket($soc, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, getprotobyname('tcp')) || die $!;
    connect($soc, sockaddr_in(80, inet_aton('google.com')))   || die $!;
    syswrite($soc,"GET / HTTP1/1.1$CRLF$CRLF")                || die $!;

    my ($status,$body,$headers) = fetch(fileno($soc));
    print Data::Dumper::Dumper([$status,$body,$headers]);

=item Hijk::HTTP::XS::fetch($fd) returns ($status,$body,$headers)

the only exported function, parses the http response and returns

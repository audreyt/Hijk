    https://github.com/joyent/http-parser

SYNOPSIS
        use strict;
        use warnings;
        use Socket qw(PF_INET SOCK_STREAM sockaddr_in inet_aton $CRLF);
        use Data::Dumper;
        use Hijk::HTTP::XS qw(fetch);

        my $soc;
        socket($soc, PF_INET, SOCK_STREAM, getprotobyname('tcp')) || die $!;
        connect($soc, sockaddr_in(80, inet_aton('google.com')))   || die $!;
        syswrite($soc,"GET / HTTP1/1.1$CRLF$CRLF")                || die $!;

        my ($status,$body,$headers) = fetch(fileno($soc));
        print Data::Dumper::Dumper([$status,$body,$headers]);

DESCRIPTION
  very simple http request parser, does not support gzip/ssl or anything
EXPORT
    Hijk::HTTP::XS::fetch($fd) returns ($status,$body,$headers)
        the only exported function, parses the http response and returns
        status_code,request body, headers hashref. Requires file descriptor
        so you just have to pass fileno($socket) to it
